4.2.4     2016-07-19

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 6.0.1
    - 6.0.2

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Various minor performance improvements made, mainly in the main render loop producing task markup. The rendering process no
    longer applies *all* task data fields to the Task template. If you use Task model data fields inside your task template,
    you should provide them through the 'eventRenderer' method.

    [API CHANGES]
    - The Gnt.panel.Gantt#tooltipTpl config now also accepts a Boolean value. The default value is now set to ´true´ which will create a default task tooltip showing
     StartDate, EndDate and PercentDone information when on hovering over a task. Set the ´tooltipTpl´ config to ´false´ to not use the standard tooltip. The new task template for the tooltip is
      localised and added to the API. You can still configure your own task tooltip using a String or Ext.Template value, which you can see in the 'gantt-scheduler' example.

    The main focus of this release has been stability and test fixes. We have also upgraded our export feature to work with
    the Ext JS buffered rendering of large data sets.

   [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 5.1.0

3.0.0-beta-2 2014-11-10
    This Ext Gantt release introduces task constraints support and task split support. Over the years, these have been
    frequently requested and we are happy to tell you that these features are now fully supported. Additionally, we have added
    a new CRUD manager, which makes it a lot easier to handle loading and saving data in the component. You can of course read
    all about the new features in our guide section of our documentation site.

   [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 5.0.1

    [KNOWN ISSUES]
    - Some translations are missing for non-English languages
    - Export feature is not yet adapted to handle buffered rendering (which is on by default in Ext JS 5)
    - Documentation of the new features is still in progress.

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Improved Touch support: Inline editing, column drag drop and resize, task Drag drop, task resize, scrolling and setting up dependencies supported.

    [API CHANGES]
    - The semantic of "ManuallyScheduled" field has been changed so that such task is only not affected by incoming dependencies
      and constraints. Also, the manually scheduled parent task is not affected by its child tasks positions and behaves like
      any other normal task. The holidays skipping rules are still applied to such tasks, according to it's (or project's) calendar.
      Previously the holiday skipping rules were not applied to such tasks. To re-enable the old behavior, create a 24/7h calendar
      in your project and assign it to such tasks.
    - The “Manual” value of the SchedulingMode field is deprecated in favor of the “ManuallyScheduled” field (so that a task can be “manually scheduled” and have a scheduling mode in the same time)
    - The TaskStore#loadData method has been deprecated (as it exists natively in Ext JS 5.0)

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed #1482: Resource model forEachAvailabilityIntervalWithTasks treats assignments calendars in a different way than task forEachAvailabilityInterval* does
    - Fixed #1575: Wrong project calendar is used in TaskEditor
    - Fixed #1592: Baseline % complete ignored
    - Fixed #1595: 1px offset when resizing or dragging task segment
    - Fixed #1600: Cmd 5 warnings for 3.x branch
    - Fixed #1611: Unhighlighing tasks causes exception
    - Fixed #1627: Selection model issues after filtering
    - Fixed #1628: Task availability iterator misses start/end dates for business time tasks
    - Fixed #1629: Task segments field should get into modified fields set after task move
    - Fixed #1631: German translation of dependency types
    - Fixed #1652: Histogram example tooltip enddate
    - Fixed #1669: Zoom to fit works incorrectly
    - Fixed #1677: Possible to create parent dependencies during inline editing
    - Fixed #1678: Dependencies refreshed after editing completed without change

3.0.0-beta-1 2014-09-25

    We're excited to announce the first public beta release of Ext Gantt 3.0. The code base has been upgraded to
    run on Ext JS 5.0.1, which adds some great new features like touch support to the Gantt component. The most notable
    new Gantt features in this release are the task constraints support and task split support. Over the years, these have been

    a new CRUD manager, which makes it a lot easier to handle loading and saving data in the component. You can of course read
    all about the new features in our guide section of our documentation site.

    Starting from this release, we no longer support IE7 since Ext JS 5 has dropped support for it.

    This is a beta release, so expect some rough edges here and there. We would be very happy to hear your feedback and
    please report any bugs in our new Ext Gantt 3.x forums: http://bryntum.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=33

      "manually scheduled" and has some scheduling mode in the same time)
    - getCount on TaskStore is now available in the superclass (TreeStore), our old method was renamed to getTotalCount. Might be a breaking change since we cannot override this safely anymore.

2.2.13    2013-11-20

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 4.2.1
    - 4.2.2

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Introduced new task properties - `successors` and `predecessors`, containing outgoing and incoming dependencies
      respectively. These properties cache the dependencies of a task, to avoid doing full scans
      of dependency store in various scenarios.
    - Implemented caching of the `hasTransitiveDependency` method, which makes the `strictDependencyValidation` checks
      more performant
    - Added a new `Gnt.plugin.TaskEditor` (and `Gnt.widget.TaskEditor`) config `assignmentGridClass` which allows you to
      provide your own implementation of the `Gnt.widget.AssignmentEditGrid` widget.

    [API CHANGES]
    - Implemented protection against cyclic dependencies during a "cascadeChanges" operation
    - The optional `dependencyStore` argument of the `hasIncomingDependencies, hasOutgoingDependencies, getAllDependencies`
      methods was removed
    - The optional `dependencyStore` argument of the `getIncomingDependencies` and `getOutgoingDependencies` methods
      was replaced with `doNotClone` argument
    - The `Sch.config.locale` option has been removed, as causing too many troubles with Sencha Cmd. Gantt now always "requires"
      english locale. Also, english locale now does not overwrite the other active non-english locale

    [BUG FIXES]
    - The "isValidDependency" method of the Gnt.data.DependencyStore now correctly returns `false` for transitive dependencies
    - Fixed #1033: problem with long projects
    - Fixed #1050: When normal grid is collapsed, normal grid should get a vertical scroller.
    - Fixed #1054: On replaceChild in some cases parend node shown as leaf

2.2.0-beta-2 2013-02-22

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - New 'instantUpdate' config on the Gnt.widget.DurationEditor class (defaults to true). When the spinners are activated, the underlying record is updated instantly.
    - New events 'dependencyclick' and 'dependencycontextmenu' fired when interacting with dependency elements.
    - Added 'triggerEvent' config option to the 'Gnt.plugin.DependencyEditor' class. Defaults to 'dependencydblclick'.

    [API CHANGES]
    - BREAKING: The requirements for "Id" field of the Gnt.model.CalendarDay were removed and "Id" can contain arbitrary unique value.
    The information previously stored in the "Id" field should be now stored in the new field "Type", "Weekday", "OverrideStartDate",
    "OverrideEndDate". This fixes a lot of issues with calendars CRUD. Calendar still can be loaded with the data in old format,
    but you should not rely on this anymore.
    - BREAKING: The internals of advanced calendar widget were significantly refactored. This feature was not documented so hopefully this change
    will not affect anyone - the public API remains the same
    - Added a new 'Note' field to the Task model.

    [BUG FIXES]
